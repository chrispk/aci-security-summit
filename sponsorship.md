                    <p>As a result of this year’s heightened security situation at European airports, underlined by the attacks on the airports in Brussels and Istanbul, ACI EUROPE has decided to convene the “ACI EUROPE Security &amp; Crisis Management Special Summit.” This will be held over two days in central Brussels 22-23 November. </p>
                    <p>The event will include Europe’s most senior security and transport administrators, case studies from the most recent and historical events, and presentations from a powerful selection of top security experts from European airports, and the leading security technology companies.</p>
                    <p>ACI EUROPE and its partner organisations and agencies place great importance on the role that technology and service providers play in providing innovating new solutions to these challenges.</p>
                    <p>Although this is a high profile event opportunities to sponsor and exhibit are extremely limited. </p>

                <p>Far from a large scale EXPO-style showcase, the exhibition at the Summit will be an exclusive networking area at the heart of the event, featuring around 20 vendors demonstrating the latest security and related technologies.</p>
                <p>As space in the downtown Brussels venue is restrictive, exhibition stands are offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Please review the <a href="{% link exhibition.md %}" title="Security Exhibition">exhibition page</a> for the latest information on exhibition space available, and <a href="{% link contact.md %}" title="Get in touch">contact our team</a> to discuss your involvement.</p>
